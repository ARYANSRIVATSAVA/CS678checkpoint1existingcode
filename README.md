This is the reproduction code for paper "The State of Profanity Obfuscation in Natural Language Processing". (Research paper link - https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.240.pdf)
The algorithm designed in this paper has some limitations. An advanced code implementation for the concept of this algorithm is designed by out team to tackle above limitations.
The improvised algorithm implementation code for this paper is almost designed and is in progress. Link - https://github.com/ARYANSRIVATSAVA/CS678checkpoint1.
